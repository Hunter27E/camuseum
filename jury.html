						<h2>Edith Blanchard</h2>
						<h3>Director of the Charles H. MacNider Museum</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Edith Blanchard is currently the Director of the Charles H. MacNider
						Museum in Mason City, Iowa. She received her master‘s degree in
						Museum Studies from Texas Tech University and has been involved in
						the Museum field for over 20 years. During her time at the MacNider
						the Museum has expanded its collection of artwork that focuses on
						persons of color as well as women. As a child Edith attended arts
						classes at the MacNider. Due to enrollment in a small school with
						little arts funding, it was here that she found her calling. Her
						aunt and uncle both worked at Living History Farms, a large living
						history museum, where she would visit in the summer. Having a
						learning disability Edith soon discovered that through hands-on
						non-traditional methods of teaching, she understood what she could
						previously could not. She determined at an early age that working in
						a museum, teaching others through non-traditional methods, was where
						she found her passion. Through her undergraduate degree she mostly
						worked in clay, taking 3 years of ceramics at Iowa State University
						while an undergraduate. Prior to coming to the MacNider in 2007 she
						worked as the Curator for the National Czech and Slovak Museum and
						Library where she developed a particular interest in the artist Andy
						Warhol, whose family were immigrants from what was then
						Czechoslovakia. Edith practices art herself selling handmade jewelry
						at summer art markets and is also fiber artist spinning wool and
						creating handmade quilts and textiles.

						<h2>Ida Ivanka Kubler</h2>
						<h3>Artistic Director</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Ida Ivanka Kubler was born in South Bulgaria close to the border to
						Greece in 1978. Growing up in the sericulture for silk cocoons of
						her grandparents gave her the inspiration to use cocoons and other
						natural materials in her artworks. She started going to art lessons
						when she was 5 years old. In her adult life she had a traditional
						figurative art training at the National Academy of Arts in Sofia,
						Bulgaria. Ida states: "We would draw and learn about the human
						anatomy for 9 hours per day, every day of the week." She holds a BA
						in Product Design and Marketing from the University of Applied
						Sciences in Bielefeld, Germany. Her most prominent series she
						started during her PgDip studies in Fine Art from Chelsea College of
						Arts, London, UK. These are abstract series made from recycled silk
						cocoons naturally left by the butterflies. Ida has had art studios
						internationally in seven countries: Bulgaria, Germany, England,
						France, Norway, Italy and USA. Her artworks have found homes in
						Australia, India, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Guernsey, Norway,
						England and USA. She states: "The main motive for my travels was
						love: either for the arts or for individuals. I spent time with the
						families of my art collectors, I organized shows. It was the search
						for beauty and the discovery of beauty in environments and
						relationships, which is my main driving force. I believe I still
						kept my Slavic soul." On a personal trip to Iowa, Ida met Lori
						Willert, the director of the Bolan's nonprofit, and together they
						started growing the seed of this idea of advancing the culture in
						Bolan, Iowa but also empowering and supporting the artists by giving
						them the opportunity to show their art in a museum. "I felt that I
						could act as a bridge between the warm, sweet people from Iowa and
						artists from around the World. It is a win-win cultural exchange,
						which will be empowering for both sides."

						honor. After moving to the United States, Maia completed her second
						master's degree in International Affairs at New York University in
						New York, USA. Maia's deep art, historical and cultural knowledge of
						Russia, Eastern and Western Europe and the United States and her
						passion for art, prompted her to immerse into the art world first as
						an art collector, and later as an art dealer and art gallery owner.
						Working as an art dealer and gallery owner enabled her to work with
						artists with different styles, from different countries and at
						different stages of their career development. In addition to her
						devotion to fine arts, Maia's interests include interior design and
						interior decoration in which artwork presence, in her view is
						indispensable. In addition to English, Maia speaks Russian, Czech,

						<h2>Pedda Borowski</h2>
						<h3>Artist</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Pedda Borowski is known as a visual artist, draftsman and painter,
						also in collaboration with other art disciplines such as music and
						dance as a performance artist. Borowski also teaches as a freelance
						lecturer in the teaching areas of artistic anatomy and spatial
						representations. He is also active as a Shiatsu practitioner GSD.
						Borowski received a diploma in drawing from the University for
						Applied Sciences in Bielefeld. After several years abroad
						(Paris/France and Cairo/Egypt) he lives and works in Berlin/Germany.
						In his current art he dedicates himself to the human figure. A
						series of large-format paintings is being created, the content of
						which is devoted, among other things, to the meridians known from
						traditional Chinese medicine. Another major artistic field of
						interest are paintings with erotic depictions of the body, which are
						in the tradition of his "artistic and spiritual parents". Georgia
						O'Keeffe, Anais Nin, Egon Schiele, Lucian Freud, August Rodin.
						Before turning to the human figure, Borowski painted spaces and
						architecture. The template for this long-lasting artistic period was
						the literature of Franz Kafka. Borowski understood these paintings
						as film stills of imaginary, i.e. never-shot films, in which Kafka's
						literature functioned as scripts. Working title of the painting
						"Silent film with voice." Borowski in the O-Ton: "I understand
						myself with my art not only as 'solo self-employed' but am very
						interested in connections with the protagonists of the Berlin art
						and cultural scene coming from all over the world. I especially like
						to make my nets with dancers and musicians!"
