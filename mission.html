				<h2>LORI 'NYDEGGER' WILLERT</h2>
				<h3>Director of the Bolan Museum</h3>
				<p>
					In my role I aim to connect the past of Bolan with the new spirit of
					the present and future, enrich culture and create a platform for
					communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Historically, the village of Bolan originated more than a century ago
					when the Chicago Great Western Railroad track was laid. The town was
					given the name Bolan in honor of the railroad master Matt Bolan in
					1886. While the rail is no longer in use and the town is not a
					sprawling metropolis, Bolan has a large population of loyal and
					sincere supporters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether people grew up here, lived on a neighboring rural acreage,
					attended Barton No. 2 School, patronized the businesses, worshiped at
					Trinity United Methodist Church, lived in a house for a couple years
					or life time, joined the community during one of its many
					celebrations, participated in Vacation Bible School, or briefly
					visited its park, this place feels like home. No matter how brief the
					stay or visit, it is a memorable community. Bolan is a place where
					friends meet, perhaps for the first time or several times over the
					years.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is inspirational to read the "Bolan News" of years ago, and to hear
					stories passed down from the previous generations. This has been a
					place of fellowship and education; persistence and progress; faith,
					hope and love for many years. It brings me great satisfaction to
					contribute toward continuing that legacy by volunteering as
					chairperson of our nonprofit organization.
				</p>
				<p>
					There have been many creative and engaging projects over the years
					that Iâ€˜ve introduced and directed. Working with residents and local
					citizens on these projects have improved our location and enhanced our
					quality of life. I love that about Bolan and living here with my
					family! Community members work to improve their own space, as
					individuals and families, while being provided their privacy. At the
					same time, opportunities for people to work together inspire more
					ideas and build lasting friendships that benefit our town and nearby
					communities as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					The landscape is beautifully lush and green with fields and gardens in
					the summer, while amazingly serene and gorgeous, covered with a
					blanket of white snow in the winter. In this atmosphere of tranquility
					and warm welcoming, in the middle of the corn fields of Iowa, we are
					planting these seeds and hoping they will grow to an opulent harvest.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an avid Bolan community promoter, I am excited to introduce to you
					the BOLAN CONTEMPORARY ART projects at the BOLAN MUSEUM housed in the
					BOLAN SCHOOLHOUSE & CULTURAL CENTER. This undertaking is the start of
					an exciting journey between art, cultural exchange, communication and
					new notions for something even bigger. We are going on this journey
					with the hope to assist local, national and international artists to
					"meet" through Bolan and give them a chance to advance in their career
					and personal development. At the same time, give the people in the
					Bolan area the opportunity to welcome new contemporary cultural
					impulses. The cultural exchange will be exciting and very rewarding.
				</p>
				<p>
					The eleven board members were quick to offer endorsement and support
					to move forward with the plans for the BOLAN CONTEMPORARY ART projects
					because this aligns well with the mission, and purpose, "To raise
					awareness of local, national and international artwork and artists."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bolan Schoolhouse & Cultural Center mission is, "To restore,
					preserve, and maintain the 1923 Barton No. 2 Schoolhouse as a center
					that shares educational history, hosts cultural experiences, and
					continues to promote Bolan as "a place where friends meet."
